# CodeBud - A Visual Coding Adventure for Kids

CodeBud is an educational game designed for preschoolers aged 4 to 7 to explore the fundamentals of programming and algorithmic thinking through engaging, visual puzzles. Built using Flutter (frontend) and Flask with MongoDB (backend), CodeBud avoids all text, making it accessible to non-readers by relying solely on colorful drag-and-drop blocks, animations, and sound feedback.

## üåü Product Vision

**FOR** preschool children aged 4 to 7,  
**WHO** are just beginning to explore thinking in sequences and logic,  
**THE** CodeBud App is an educational app  
**THAT** helps develop programming and algorithmic thinking skills through interactive, visual puzzles.  
**UNLIKE** traditional text-based tools,  
**OUR PRODUCT** provides a completely text-free, drag-and-drop interface with friendly animations and sounds, making coding concepts like sequencing, loops, and conditionals intuitive and fun for early learners.

## ‚ú® Core Features

### 1. Drag-and-Drop Command Blocks
- Visual icons like arrows and turns instead of text.
- Children drag blocks onto a sequence strip to form a "code".
- Icons are large, colorful, and animated.

### 2. Puzzle-Based Levels
- Guide CodeBud to reach the star.
- Levels gradually introduce complexity: straight paths ‚Üí turns ‚Üí obstacles ‚Üí logic.
- Each level has a grid-based layout with defined start and goal positions.

### 3. Loops (Simplified)
- Introduce visual loop blocks like ‚ÄúRepeat X times‚Äù.
- Children can drag commands into the loop block and set a number of iterations visually.

### 4. If-Then Logic (Visual Conditionals)
- Introduces basic logic: e.g., `If rock ahead ‚Üí turn right`.
- Uses icons for conditions and actions, eliminating any reading requirement.
- Teaches logical branching in a visual and intuitive way.

### 5. Interactive Feedback and Rewards
- Sound effects like claps and cheerful tones when the player succeeds.
- Animations such as CodeBud jumping or stars shining.
- Star-based reward system (1 to 3 stars based on move efficiency).
